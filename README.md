# MADRA: Quadruped Robotic Guide Dog

Welcome to the official companion site for **MADRA (Medical Autonomous Droid Remote Assistant)** — a quadruped robotic guide dog designed to assist individuals with blindness and vision impairment (BVI) through fully onboard object detection and voice interaction.

This site offers supporting media and materials referenced in the paper.

---

## Project Summary

MADRA runs entirely on a Unitree Go1 Edu platform, using only its native onboard hardware. It supports:

- **Voice-guided mobility** using a Vosk-based wakeword + command system  
- **Obstacle awareness** with a fisheye-adapted YOLOv8 object detector  
- **Multimodal navigation** including leash-based guidance and semi-autonomous modes  
- **Field testing** in a simulated urban facility replicating public transport and terrain challenges

## Demo Videos

These videos correspond to the **three-part testing structure** from the paper (Section II.E and Table III):

| Test Phase                | Description                                       | Video |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|-------|
| **Terrain Traversal**     | MADRA crossing gravel, ramps, and concrete | [Watch](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YuEDupqHcTejxY4UnGiHg9LeYNgSlZg7/view?usp=drive_link) |
| **Stair Climbing**        | Inclined stair ascent using standard gait         | [Watch](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uDg50wn8Ia0FKkLn-5p9iieBwtFtvfr9/view?usp=drive_link) |
| **Crosswalk Detection**   | Object classification using YOLOv8n + audio cue   | [Watch](https://drive.google.com/file/d/13FYVZR2MGwEMnntFbif5GTtFpPSyTAgs/view?usp=drive_link) |

Each clip reflects qualitative test outcomes and system behavior during real deployment.

## System Highlights

- **Wakeword-activated voice interface** using “Guide Dog”
- **Command parsing** via predefined YAML/JSON vocabulary
- **Live object detection** (crosswalks, stairs, doors, people) with confidence-based feedback
- **No reliance on external GPUs or cloud** — everything runs onboard

## Testing Environment

Testing was conducted at the **Wayfinding Centre** (Dublin), which offers high-fidelity urban simulation.  
Tests included:
- Parallel/perpendicular crosswalk alignment
- Stair ascent
- Tram boarding with gap navigation
- Multi-surface terrain (gravel, tiles, slope)
